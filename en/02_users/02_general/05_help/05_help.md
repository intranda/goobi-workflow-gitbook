# 2.5. Help function

Towards the right-hand edge of the menu bar there is an option to call the integrated Help function. This can be used for many of the input boxes in Goobi and shows you which information is required and where. As well as an explanation of the content required in each field, the Help function will often provide examples.

Please note, however, that the Help function does not provide explanations for every area of Goobi. They are available only for input forms and boxes.
