# 2.7. Changing your password

As with any other technical system, you should change your password from time to time for security reasons. To do so, click on your user name in the menu bar and then select the `Change password` option. This will display the following screen:

To change your password, enter your new password in the two boxes below. The change will take effect when you click `Save`. When you next log in to Goobi and from then onwards, you will have to use your new password. Do not disclose your password to any other users. In order to create a secure password, you need to use a mixture of special characters, numbers, both lower and upper case letters and at least 8 characters in total.
