# Moving structure elements

There are several ways in which you can subsequently modify the structure of a document.

One of these involves moving structure elements to a different position. To do this, first select the structure element from the structure tree. Next, in the `Selected docstruct` box, select the function `Move docstruct up` or `Move docstruct down` to move the selected element by one position in the required direction.

However, if you want to move the structure element to a different position within the hierarchy, you will need to select the function `Move docstruct to other location`. This will open a dialogue box in which you can specify exactly where you want to place the structure element. You will be able to select only from those locations permitted by the Goobi ruleset.
