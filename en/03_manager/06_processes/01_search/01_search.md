# Searching processes

If you want to search for specific processes, you can use Goobi’s extended search function. To do this, select the menu bar option `Workflow – Search for volume`.

![Extended dialogue box for process searches](screen1_en.png)

In order to conduct a finely tuned search, Goobi’s `Search for volume` dialogue box uses a filter syntax that makes it possible to identify the requested processes on the database.

The above diagrams show how a search is performed in Goobi using its internal search syntax based on the search details entered in the dialogue box. The search syntax generated by Goobi can be seen in the filter box Find processes above the table and can be extended to include additional parameters. It is also possible to save a search in case it is needed on future occasions. It will then appear in the drop-down list of pre-defined filters and can be executed at any time.

Below you will find an explanation of the background filter syntax. This is useful because manually combining the search parameters described below allows you to perform more detailed searches than is the case simply using the dialogue box. The following table contains a description of some typical search filters and how they work.

## Examples of the detailed filter syntax for use with process searches

| Filter syntax | Description of function |
| :--- | :--- |
| ab | Filter to display all processes from all projects that contain `ab` in the process title. |
| -ab | Filter to display all processes that do not contain `ab` in the process title. |
| ab -abc | Filter to display all processes that contain `ab` in the process title, but not `abc`.  |
| a?c | Filter to display all processes that contain `a`, one arbitrary character and `c`. The search pattern `a?c` does not search for `ab`. |
| a\*c | Filter to display all processes that contain `a`, multiple arbitrary characters and `c`. Because `\*` can also be "no characters", the search pattern `a*c` does also search for `ac`. |
| meta:Shelfmark:123 | Filter to display all processes with the condition that the metadata item `Shelfmark` must contain the value `123`. |
| meta:Author:Mustermann | Filter to display all processes with the condition that the metadata item `Author` must contain the value `Mustermann`. |
| "meta:Author:Max Mustermann" "meta:Author:John Doe" | Filter to display all processes for which both the authors `Max Mustermann` and `John Doe` have been recorded. |
| meta:index.Person:Mustermann | Filter to display all processes that contain the value `Mustermann` in the `Persons index`. |

| -meta:Shelfmark:\* | Filter to display all processes that have no `Shelfmark`. |
| batch:3 | Filter to display all processes allocated to the `batch` with the number `3`. |
| -batch:3 | Filter to display all processes which are not allocated to the `batch` with the number `3`. |

| stepDone:7 | Filter to display all processes from all projects for which the workflow step with the sequential number `7` has already been `completed`. |
| stepOpen:7 | Filter to display all processes from all projects for which the workflow step with the sequential number `7` is `waiting to be processed` by a user. |
| stepInFlight:7 | Filter to display all processes from all projects for which the workflow step with the sequential number `7` is `currently waiting in a queue`. |
| stepInWork:7 | Filter to display all processes from all projects for which the workflow step with the sequential number `7` is `currently being processed`. |
| stepLocked:7 | Filter to display all processes from all projects for which the workflow step with the sequential number `7` is still `locked`. |
| stepDeactivated:7 | Filter to display all processes from all projects for which the workflow step with the sequential number `7` is currently `deactivated`. |
| stepError:7 | Filter to display all processes from all projects for which the workflow step with the sequential number `7` has `entered an error state`. |
| stepDone:4 stepLocked:7 | Filter to display all processes for which at least workflow step `4` has been `completed` but step `7` has `not yet been released for processing`. |
| stepInWork:Imaging | Filter to display all processes for which a workflow step with the name `Imaging` is `currently being processed`. |
| stepDone:Export "project:sample project" | Filter to display all processes belonging to the project `sample project` for which a workflow step with the name `Export` has already been `completed`. |
| "id:17 18 19" | Filter to display all processes with the internal Goobi `identifiers` `17`, `18` or `19`. |
| template:123 | Filter to display all processes for which the `physical source` contains a `property` including the value `123`. |
| template:shelfmark:123 intranda | Filter to display all processes for which the `shelfmark` property of the `physical source` contains the value `123` and the `process name` contains `intranda`. |
| workpiece:intranda | Filter to display all processes for which the property of the associated `workpiece` contains the value `intranda`. |
| workpiece:Artist:intranda | Filter to display all processes for which the workpiece property `Artist` contains the value `intranda`. |
| workpiece:Artist:intranda process:shelfmark:123 "project:sample project" stepDone:Imaging 456 | Filter to display all processes from the project `sample project` for which the process name contains `456`; at least the workflow step `Imaging` has been `completed`; the `shelfmark` of the `physical source` contains `123`, and the `workpiece property Artist` contains `intranda`. |
| processproperty:Font:fra | Filter for all processes whose `process property` `Font` contains the value `fra`. |
| project:Berlin \|project:London | OR-Search for all processes whose `project title` contains either `Berlin` or `London`. |
| "project:Palma de Mallorca" "\|project:New York" | OR-Search for all processes whose `project title` contains either `Palma de Mallorce` or `New York`. The individual search parameters are set in `quotation marks` here, since the project titles contain spaces here.. |
| "meta:TitleDocMain:1801" "\|meta:TitleDocMain:1802" | Or search for all processes whose `metadata` contains `1801` or `1802` in the `main title`. The `quotation marks` are only necessary if spaces are contained within the search term.. |
| processdate=2021 | Search for processes whose `creation date` is in the year ´2021\`. |
| processdate!=2021 | Search for processes whose `creation date` is not in the year ´2021\`. |
| "processdate&lt;2020-01-01 12:00:00" | Search for processes whose `creation date` is before `01.01.2020 12:00:00`. |
| processdate&gt;2020-01-01 processdate&lt;2020-12-31 | Search for processes whose `creation date` is after `01.01.2020` and before `31.12.2020`. |
| stepdone:Scanning stepfinishdate:2021 | Search for workflow steps with the title `Scanning` completed in the year `2021`. |
| stepstartdate:2021 | Search for workflow steps whose processing started in `2021`. |
| stepdone:Scanning "stepdone:Quality control" stepfinishdate:2021 | Search for workflow steps `Scanning` and `Quality control` both completed in `2021`. |
| stepdone:Scanning stepfinishdate&gt;2021-08-01 stepfinishdate&lt;2021-08-31 | Search for workflow steps `Scanning` completed in `August 2021`. |
| stepDone:Scanning processdate=2021 \|processdate=2022 | Searches for processes that are created in the year 2022 or contain steps `Scanning` and are created in the year 2021. |
| stepDone:Scanning (processdate=2021 \|processdate=2022) | Searches for processes that contain steps `Scanning` and are created in the year 2021 or 2022. Brackets can be nested arbitrarily to determine the priority and thus the execution order of the individual AND and OR conditions. |

**Note:** The operators `<` and `>` are interpreted in the background as `less than or equal to` and `greater than or equal to`. For example, searching for `processdate>2022` will list all processes whose creation date is 2022 and later.

As you can see from the examples given above, it is possible to conduct some very complex filter-based searches by combining a wide range of parameters. Unlike the simple filters you can apply in the dialogue box, by using the correct filter syntax you can use the same parameters more than once with different values for a single search (e.g. to simultaneously retrieve both completed workflow steps and others that are still in progress).

All the parameters listed above can be combined with each other as required. Please note, however, that any parameters containing a blank space should be written inside double quotation marks.
