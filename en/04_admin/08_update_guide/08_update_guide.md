# Update guide

This section contains detailed documentation on how to carry out updates to Goobi workflow. An update should always be carried out in such a way that a backup of the important data is made beforehand. The creation of a backup and other useful preparatory work is documented on this page:

{% content-ref url="9.1.md" %}
[9.1.md](9.1.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Once the preparatory work has been successfully completed, the actual update can take place. This is described in this documentation so that the Goobi workflow can be updated step by step from the installed version to the latest version.

{% content-ref url="9.2/" %}
[9.2](9.2/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
