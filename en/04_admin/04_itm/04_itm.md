# Working with the intranda Task Manager

Goobi communicates with the `intranda Task Manager` via the `TaskClient`. In Goobi, this command line program is configured as part of a workflow step. It can accept and process a number of parameters. The parameters required depend on the nature of the task to be performed by the intranda Task Manager. The parameters expected and validated for OCR, for example, are different from those required for SDB.

Details of the `intranda Task Manager` and how it works with Goobi can be found in the intranda Task Manager documentation.\
