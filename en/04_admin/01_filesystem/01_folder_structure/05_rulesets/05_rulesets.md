# ‘rulesets’ sub-directory

Within Goobi, the UGH class library is used to process metadata, map PICA imports and generate METS files. In order to manage the huge variety of configuration options, UGH uses a mechanism known as rulesets. The `rulesets` directory is the central storage location for these rulesets. It allows you to make individual configurations available for different projects and types of publication.
