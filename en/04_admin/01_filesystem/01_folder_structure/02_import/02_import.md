# ‘import’ sub-directory

Depending on the way Goobi has been installed, the `import` directory will contain a range of data, mostly on a temporary basis. By way of example, import plug-ins use this directory to enter metadata and associated digital content in order to create processes. The respective import plug-ins are also responsible for deleting files that are no longer needed.
